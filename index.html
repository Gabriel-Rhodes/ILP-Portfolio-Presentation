      <p id="description-text">&emsp;&emsp;Over the past school year, I have worked using the BSD program to learn to code. Over the last bit of time I have made projects revolving around my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The first few projects for BSD were simple hand holding guides, but the work slowly progressed in difficulty. Over the past few months, I've created a few projects that I share on this website.</p>

      <p id="description-text">&emsp;&emsp;My first project is a HTML documentation with code examples. You can find that by clicking on the codepen link <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/TOPGames/pen/NWpxrMK">here</a>. In the project, I give a basic synopsis of HTML, a few elements, and the uses of the language. This documentation was loosly based off of the MDN language references that I use for my projects which can be found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">here</a>. <br></br>&emsp;&emsp;My second project was a simple survey that sends informatin to a library. It can save the user inputs to a library, from which one would be able to make a collection of the data for whatever. That codepen can be found <a href="https://codepen.io/TOPGames/pen/eYgqqbB">here</a>. I used many different types of the input element and the list element to create the survey, resulting in a simple form that can be completed and submitted. <br></br>&emsp;&emsp;Lastly, I created this website as a presentation using HTML, CSS, and JS. I incorperated several CSS animations with JS triggers, as well as used several different combinations of HTML elements to create a nav bar, links, and code examples. The GitHub repository where this code is kept can be found <a href="https://github.com/Gabriel-Rhodes/ILP-Portfolio-Presentation">here</a>.</p>
